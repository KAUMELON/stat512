E-mail: pratheesh.pg@kau.in Thank you! This book is a collection of all lecture notes covering the syllabus of EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS, which is a common course of statistics in Post graduate programmes in Agriculture under Kerala Agricultural University Syllabus Objective This course is meant for students of agricultural and animal sciences other than Agricultural Statistics. Designing an experiment is an integrated component of research in almost all sciences. The students would be exposed to concepts of Design of Experiments so as to enable them to understand the concepts involved in planning, designing their experiments and analysis of experimental data. Theory UNIT I Need for designing of experiments, characteristics of a good design. Basic principles of designs - randomization, replication and local control. UNIT II Uniformity trials, size and shape of plots and blocks; Analysis of variance; Completely randomized design, randomized block design and Latin square design. UNIT III Factorial experiments, (symmetrical as well as asymmetrical). orthogonality and partitioning of degrees of freedom, Confounding in symmetrical factorial experiments, Factorial experiments with control treatment. UNIT IV Split plot and strip plot designs; Analysis of covariance and missing plot techniques in randomized block and Latin square designs; Transformations, crossover designs, balanced incomplete block design, Lattice design, Response surfaces. UNIT V Bioassays- direct and indirect, potency estimation. Practical Uniformity trial data analysis, formation of plots and blocks, Fairfield Smith Law; Analysis of data obtained from CRD, RBD, LSD; Analysis of factorial experiments without and with confounding; Analysis with missing data; Split plot and strip plot designs; Transformation of data; Fitting of response surfaces and Bioassays.

Basic principles of designs - randomization, replication and local control 1.1 Design of experiments Any scientific investigation involves formulation of certain assertions (or hypotheses) whose validity is examined through the data generated from an experiment conducted for the purpose. The term experimentis defined as the systematic procedure carried out under controlled conditions in order to discover an unknown effect, to test or establish a hypothesis, or to illustrate a known effect. Experiments can be designed in many different ways to collect information. Design of experiments (DOE) is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. In other words, it is used to find cause-and-effect relationships. DOE is a structured approach for conducting experiments. Mainly aims at Validity Reliability Replicability Optimality Design of experiment means how to design an experiment. In the sense that how the observations or measurements should be obtained to answer a query in a valid, efficient and economical way. The designing of experiment and the analysis of obtained data are inseparable. If the experiment is designed properly keeping in mind the question, then the data generated is valid and proper analysis of data provides the valid statistical inferences. If the experiment is not well designed, the validity of the statistical inferences is questionable and may be invalid. 1.2 Importance of DoE Reduce, control and provides an estimate of the experimental Error Gives a structured approach It reduce cost of experiment with considerable reliability Produces statistically valid results Allows to accommodate changes Reduce complexity Improves accountability 1.3 Characteristics of a good design Provides unbiased estimates of the factor effects and associated uncertainties Enables the experimenter to detect important differences Includes the plan for analysis and reporting of the results Gives results that are easy to interpret Permits conclusions that have wide validity Minimal resource usage Is as simple as possible "],["references.html", "2 References", " 2 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
