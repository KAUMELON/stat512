Basic principles of designs - randomization, replication and local control 2.1 Design of experiments Any scientific investigation involves formulation of certain assertions (or hypotheses) whose validity is examined through the data generated from an experiment conducted for the purpose. The term experimentis defined as the systematic procedure carried out under controlled conditions in order to discover an unknown effect, to test or establish a hypothesis, or to illustrate a known effect. Experiments can be designed in many different ways to collect information. Design of experiments (DOE) is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process.
