## Design of experiments  
Any scientific investigation involves formulation of certain assertions (or hypotheses) whose validity is examined through the data generated from an experiment conducted for the purpose. The term '*experiment*'is defined as the systematic procedure carried out under controlled conditions in order to discover an unknown effect, to test or establish a hypothesis, or to illustrate a known effect.  

Experiments can be designed in many different ways to collect information. **Design of experiments** (DOE) is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. In other words, it is used to find cause-and-effect relationships.  

DOE is a structured approach for conducting experiments. Mainly aims at  

- Validity  

- Reliability  

- Replicability  

- Optimality
