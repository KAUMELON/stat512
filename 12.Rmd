# How to use F table {#ftable}  

The table below gives a model critical values table of F (also known as statistical table of F) at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level of significance. Critical values of F can be generated now a days using softwares (Microsoft Excel, R) 

1.	Obtain your F-ratio from ANOVA or using the formula. 
2.	This has (**x**,**y**) degrees of freedom associated with it. For example, in ANOVA there are treatment degrees of freedom (**x**) and error degrees of freedom (**y**)
3.	Go along **x** columns, and down **y** rows. The point of intersection is your critical F-ratio. 
4.	If your obtained value of F is equal to or larger than this critical F-value, then you can reject the null hypothesis stating all the population means are equal with 100(1-$\alpha$)%, here 100(1-0.05) % = 95% confidence. 
5.	An example: If you obtain an F ratio of 3.26 with (2, 24) degrees of freedom. Go along 2 columns and down 24 rows. The critical value of F is 3.40. My obtained F-ratio is less than this, and so I conclude that there is no enough evidence to reject null hypothesis.

## Generate critical value of F using excel  

To find the F critical value in Excel, you can use the F.INV.RT() function, which uses the following syntax:  

= F.INV.RT(probability, deg_freedom1, deg_freedom2).  

for example for F(2, 24) at $\alpha$=0.05, Excel function will be 
> = F.INV.RT(0.05, 2, 24).
